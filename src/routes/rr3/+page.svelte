<Section title="Chapter 3 Reading Response">
    <p>
        I wanted to respond to the idea in <ArtDes />, chapter 3, page 129, about the fact that we
        mostly display things in discrete timesteps. I'm the kind of person who has a 240hz monitor.
        It mainly helps with increasing reaction speed in video games, since compared to a 60hz
        monitor it takes a quarter as long for events to display on screen. But even for other
        activities, it's really nice to have a smoother display. Even just moving the mouse around
        or scrolling feels better.

        When I first learned that movies were often only shot at 24 frames per second, I was
        initially pretty surprised. It seems like that's almost low enough to be visibly choppy, and
        thus ruin the immersion. But that appears to not happen, given that movies are as popular as
        they are. The choice of 24 frames per second appears to be standard enough that people are
        just used to it, and anything higher feels unnatural.

        On the other side of the coin, we have virtual reality displays, which were mentioned in
        <ArtDes />. I think one of the main reason why this technology took so long to become
        commonplace was because framerates that were too low just didn't work. I'm normally pretty
        resilient to motion sickness, but whenever I used virtual reality goggles and a game started
        to slow down, I got sick almost instantly due to the stuttering. It's almost like the
        lowered framerate was in an uncanny valley for my brain, with my sense of vision falling out
        of sync with my other senses of motion. So in the case of virtual reality, it's incredibly
        important for high framerates to be always available.

    <p>
        This gap between the framerate of movies and the framerate of virtual reality made me
        consider how our brains process these virtual displays. It seems plausible that we can
        tolerate the low framerate of movies because our brain is able to tell it apart from
        reality. If it were to go higher, it would look almost too realistic and make us
        subconsciously uncomfortable. But for virtual reality, which is intended to fool the brain,
        we are still trying to improve the technology to sync the senses as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        And I think that says something about experiences that happen physically, instead of on a
        monitor. We don't need to have any kind of advanced technology to make live experiences look
        realistic, because they already are. So, in my eyes, that makes them all the more special.
