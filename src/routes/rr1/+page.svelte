<Section title="Chapter 1 Reading Response">
    <p>
        I wanted to respond to the idea of the <i>sublime</i>, found in <ArtDes />, chapter 1, page
        50. When I initially read this section, the description of a sublime experience really
        resonated with me. I felt like I had had this experience several times in the past. At one
        point I had even described it to my friends on Discord (at an appropriate time of day):
    </p>
    <Image src="/hw1/ss1.png" alt="me trying to describe a sublime experience to my friends" />
    <p>
        The mood seemed to match incredibly closely to Ge's idea of the sublime: wonder and yet also
        terror.
    </p>
    <Image src="/hw1/ss2.png" alt="describing my emotions" />
    <p>
        At the time I had no idea of any sort of name for this phenomenon, or even any idea whether
        anyone else had experienced this, so I was extremely thankful to see it laid out in <ArtDes />.
        Maybe it's not so indescribable after all.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I also had my doubts. These things that triggered a sublime experience tended to fall
        significantly more into the "end-in-itself" category. This particular sublime experience
        above was from seeing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-c_g9Mx3T4"
            >awesome song with a very artistic storyboard.</a>
        Yet in <ArtDes />, the main point of the discussion was about things that were not only
        ends-in-themselves, but also means-to-ends. This made me wonder, are my experiences not true
        sublime experiences in the way that Ge had described them?
    </p>
    <p>
        After some reconsideration (and rereading a few days later), I think that yes, I had in fact
        experienced a true sublime experience. I believe I had misinterpreted the text as saying
        that sublime experiences always must come from artful design, when in fact it is possible to
        feel the sublime from things that are not. The point I believe Ge was trying to make is that
        in attempting to design, you should strive to trigger these experiences, as they are a
        natural result of seeing artful design. Ge notes that the sublime can be "induced by
        poetics, art, moral action, spirituality, [and] objects of nature", and these often don't
        have a designed function associated with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, I'm very thankful to have experienced the sublime, and thankful for my past self
        for caring and writing down my thoughts about them. I believe that with this perspective,
        I'll be able to have a much better idea what to strive for when attempting artful design.
