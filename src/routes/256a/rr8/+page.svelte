        Man, this book was amazing. I've never read anything like it, and I'm not sure I'll ever
        read anything like it again.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't have anything specific to respond to in this chapter, so I'll respond to nothing, or
        maybe everything. I just wanted to sayâ€”I love this class so much. It's my favorite class
        I've ever taken here at Stanford. I feel like I say this about a class every quarter, but
        this time the record will be REALLY hard to beat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last Thursday, after Ge's guest lecture, we had a class discussion. It was such a good
        discussion; it all felt so natural, so open, so inclusive, and we talked about deep yet
        relevant and timely topics that somehow made me both hopeful and worried for my future.
        However, I did not say a single word. Part of this was simply because I was tired; I had had
        a bad argument with a friend the previous night and wasn't in the best of mental states. But
        I was also deep in thought about the discussion, thinking about how what we were saying
        applied to my life, and also thinking about how lucky I was to be in that room.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I think about the reasons I took Music 256a, my mind goes specifically to the
        internship I had this summer. Despite my usually rather awful performance in interviews,
        thanks to a recommendation from my research advisor I managed to acquire a position at a San
        Francisco startup called
        <a href="https://www.eventualcomputing.com/">Eventual</a>. The company had already existed
        for a couple years but I was still only the seventh or eighth employee there.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like many San Francisco startups, we were working at the cutting edge of technology. Being
        2024, AI was all the rage, and despite not working <i>directly</i> with AI, we were still closely
        connected to the subject because our main product was a dataframe. Dataframes are programming
        tools capable of manipulating large amounts of data, and they are essential for AI companies
        who are trying to get as much data for training as possible. Thus, almost all of our clients
        were AI companies, and I got to be in a lot of meetings with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This came to mind during the class discussion because we spent a lot of time talking about
        how companies are disincentivized from artful design due to solely worrying about profit,
        profit, profit. But I feel incredibly fortunate because my startup <i>wasn't</i> like that. Our
        main product was totally open source and while of course we were thinking about monetization,
        it was still an "in the future" thing even by the time I left. So I got to spend my internship
        just thinking about ways that we could make a better, more useful product. And it makes me sad
        that companies can't all be like this.
    </p>
    <p>
        But more importantly for the class is not what was happening at work, but what was happening
        afterwards. This job was my first internship, and my first summer spent away from home in
        Seattle. I was living by myself in the middle of San Francisco. As a not very social person,
        I didn't have many activities away from home, so I had a lot of time for myself to play
        video games and think.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learned a lot about myself that summer. My parents (my mom especially) are the kind of
        people very focused on opportunity and success, so I feel like without them around the whole
        time, and without CS classes to worry about, I was able to think more deeply about my life.
        From somewhere deep inside of me, an artful side began to emerge. I talked about it in vague
        terms in
        <Link href="/rr1/">RR1</Link> but I mainly had the epiphany that art is what gives us our humanity.
        As I put it, any intelligent alien will come up with the exact same equations as a physicist
        or mathematician, but only humans are able to produce truly creative works of art. And if I went
        my life without creating art of my own, was I really living as a human?
    </p>
    <p>
        And there you have the reason I'm taking two music classes this quarter. I am unspeakably
        grateful I am taking this class at the time I am now. I'm not sure if I would have gotten
        quite as much out of this class had I taken it last year before my "awakening" this summer.
        So many things I believe in were repeated in the book exactly as I had thought about them,
        and then elaborated further beyond that. I have never been among a group of people who so
        closely share my mentality about art and life, and it has been so incredibly validating to
        learn that I'm not alone in thinking this way. Before this quarter I had never been to or
        even heard of CCRMA, but after this class I'm not sure I ever want to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for reading this excessively long reading response! The quarter definitely isn't
        over yet, and I'm excited to see what I and others will come up with for the final project.
